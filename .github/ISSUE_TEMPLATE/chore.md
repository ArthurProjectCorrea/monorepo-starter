## üîß Task Description

Describe the technical task or maintenance required:

- **Type of task:** (Dependency upgrade, code cleanup, script/automation, infra, CI/CD, etc.)
- **Motivation/justification:** (Why is this needed? Is it blocking something? Is it technical debt?)
- **Is it routine or one-off?** (E.g., regular update, migration, infra change)
- **Potential impact:** (Could it break something? Affect build, deploy, CI/CD?)
- **Dependencies or order:** (Should it be done before/after another task? Is it blocking something else?)
- **What is out of scope?** (Anything intentionally not included)

Example:

> Upgrade all workspace dependencies to latest minor versions. Motivation: keep security and compatibility. Routine task, no breaking changes expected. Should be done before next release. Out of scope: major upgrades.
