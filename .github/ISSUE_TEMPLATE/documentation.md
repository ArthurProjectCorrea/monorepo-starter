## üìö Documentation Description

Describe the documentation need in detail:

- **What is missing or unclear?** (API, onboarding, usage, migration, troubleshooting, etc.)
- **Target audience:** (New devs, backend, frontend, QA, external users, etc.)
- **Format:** (Markdown, code comments, diagrams, guides, FAQ, etc.)
- **Motivation:** (Why is this documentation needed? Is it a recurring doubt? Is it for onboarding? Is it for compliance?)
- **Examples or references:** (Links to similar docs, code, or external references)
- **Known pain points:** (Where do people usually get stuck? What is most confusing?)
- **What is out of scope?** (Anything intentionally not included)

Example:

> Add a migration guide for v3 to v4 in docs/monorepo/migration.md. Target: all devs. Format: markdown with code samples. Motivation: recurring confusion in onboarding. Out of scope: legacy features.
